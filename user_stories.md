4. As a marketing research team member, I want the results of the focus group to be presented in an easy to understand format so that I can show these results to other teams to determine the subsequent strategic steps. 

5. As a developer, I want to track the number of clicks on each image so that I can provide accurate data to the marketing research team.
6. As a developer, I want to track the number of clicks as a percentage of the times an image was shown to give a more complete picture of the focus group data.

13. As a focus group participant, I want the images to be presented in the same size and format so that my clicks are not influenced by how the images are presented.
